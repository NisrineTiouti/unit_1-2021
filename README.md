# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

The owner of the local game shop is an enthusiast of classic computer games. He has been looking for a talented programmer that can help him revive his passion for text-based games. He has few requirements for this task:

1. The game has to be entirely text-based.
2. The game must record the time played.
3. The game must record the player name and score.

Apart for this requirements, the owner is open to any type of game, topic or genre.

## Proposed Solution
**Design Statement:**
I will design and make a a classic text-based computer game for a client who is an owner of the local game shop. The game will be a dragon collecting game and is constructed using the software Python. It will take 3 weeks to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria shown below .

**Justification of tools used:**
1. Python is a very popular language nowadays. Google search trends for 2019 place Python as the second most sought for language on the net.
2. The Python code is really easy to write because it is very similar to the English language. In fact, that was the whole idea behind the project. The developers wanted to make a program that would be easy to understand. The code uses English keywords instead of punctuations, making it immensely easy to use even for beginners.
3.  by March 2019 there have been 23,122,064 hits for Python download for Windows users. This translates into 59.37% of hits established for the period. And since i have a HP laptop, Python is the right choice for me to develop this game.

## Success Criteria
1. The game has to be entirely text-based.
2. The game must record the time played.
3. The game must record the player name and score.
4. The game must output a table with the dragons collected and username.
5. The game must give the user time to rest if needed.
6. The game will be developed in english.
# Criteria B: Design

## System Diagram

**fig.1**: System Diagram for the proposed solution. In this this diagram you''ll see a representation of where the game is running, the user name and score is the data stored in the game. Pycharm is the sfotware where the game is being developed. Windows is the operating system for that software and the computer is the electronic device and home of them all. You can also see the inputs that are being inputed by the keyboard and outputed on the screen in Pycharm's terminal.
## Flow Diagrams

## Caesar Cypher

The databse in the game has to be protected so that personal data is not exposed. To solve this requirement I am using the Caesar Cypher. **Fig 2**
